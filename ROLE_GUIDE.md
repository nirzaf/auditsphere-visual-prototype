# AuditSphere — All User Role Views, Features, Functionalities and Privileges

**Document version:** 2.0 — role-view specification and interactive prototype guide
**Source baseline:** STE-PRD-001, revision 1.0; especially §2.1 (14 roles), §2.2 (approval records), §21 (workspaces), and the cited lifecycle requirements.
**Source attachment:** `STE Audit & Accounting Practice Platform — Project Requirements and Client Lifecycle.docx`
**Source attachment SHA-256:** `2008eab24851566d995db9bd96a046d6cd7b1ff75611341a379e7db1af5b2925`
**Artifact scope:** A new derivative of the earlier local prototype. The Google document, source attachment, original prototype and actual AuditSphere repository are unchanged.

> All 14 source roles are represented. Source-defined duties and restrictions are distinguished from proposed screen layouts, narrower demo grants and representative frontend interactions. This is not evidence that every production feature, methodology, integration or access control is implemented.

## 1. What is included

The companion `AuditSphere_All_Role_Portals_v2.html` supplies one application shell with fourteen simulated user experiences. The top-right **DEMO PERSONA — NOT A LOGIN** selector changes the homepage, navigation, visible synthetic records and eligible actions. The **All 14 role views** directory shows each role’s feature areas and handoffs. **Privileges & boundaries** provides a matrix of 44 proposed activity families and 14 roles. The complete original requirements remain a read-only reference.

Roles are not a seniority ladder. A partner is not automatically an EQR reviewer, client signatory, billing approver or systems administrator. Technical administration is not professional authority. A client administrator is not automatically authorized to sign accounts. These distinctions follow STE-PRD-001 §2.1 and GOV-01–04.

## 2. Source-derived rules versus proposed UI design

| Layer | Status in this deliverable | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| The fourteen role titles and core duties/restrictions | Source-derived | STE-PRD-001 §2.1 |
| Separate approval decisions, version binding, no self-approval, bounded delegation | Source-derived | GOV-01–04; LC-20–23 |
| Client versus internal visibility; no cross-entity leakage | Source-derived | DATA-04; NFR-01–02; UX-03 |
| Named dashboards, navigation arrangement, demo people, assigned entity sets | Proposed interface mapping | Requires product/firm approval before production |
| Forty-four activity families and their narrower role defaults | Proposed permission mapping | Individual grants and firm policy must approve |
| Forms, checkboxes and local approval state in HTML | Frontend simulation | No real authentication, signatures or professional acceptance |

A role can combine compatible duties in production only under an explicit authority/assignment policy. Independence and maker/checker restrictions still apply to the actual individual and specific version; switching labels must not erase the person’s prior participation. The prototype switches among distinct fictional people to illustrate the handoff.

## 3. Role catalogue at a glance

| ID | Source role | Role homepage | View category |
|---|---|---|
| R01 | Relationship owner | Relationship workspace | Commercial |
| R02 | Onboarding coordinator | Onboarding workspace | Commercial |
| R03 | Compliance officer | Compliance workspace | Commercial |
| R04 | Engagement partner / lead auditor | Partner workspace | Professional |
| R05 | Engagement manager | Manager workspace | Professional |
| R06 | Preparer / associate | Preparation workspace | Professional |
| R07 | Senior reviewer | Review workspace | Professional |
| R08 | Engagement quality reviewer | Quality review workspace | Professional |
| R09 | Client administrator | Client administration | Client |
| R10 | Client finance contributor | Client finance workspace | Client |
| R11 | Client authorized signatory | Management approval workspace | Client |
| R12 | Billing officer | Billing workspace | Operations |
| R13 | Records administrator | Records workspace | Operations |
| R14 | System administrator | System administration | Operations |

R01–R14 are navigation identifiers introduced by this guide, not replacements for source requirement IDs. The source does not require a separate website for each role. One shell with role-specific views is the proposed visualization design.

## 4. Shared privilege model

For every action, assess **identity → active status → practice/entity/engagement assignment → document classification → action authority → current state/revision → segregation of duties → applicable holds**. Read, prepare, submit, review, management authorization, professional authorization, dispatch, retention administration and system operation are separate capabilities. A completed task is not an approval.

| Privilege | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| View | Read an explicitly authorized record or projection | Client sees its request, not internal review discussion |
| Prepare | Create or revise a permitted draft | Preparer drafts an adjustment |
| Submit | Freeze/send a version into a separate review stage | Coordinator submits an intake file |
| Review | Assess another individual’s work within assigned authority | Senior reviewer clears an evidence-backed response |
| Management authorization | Client decides matters for which management is responsible | Accounts, adjustments, terms and representations |
| Professional authorization | Authorized professional owns a scoped conclusion | Partner opinion/report authorization |
| Independent quality review | Eligible independent reviewer evaluates required judgments | EQR completion is not partner authorization |
| Execute approved instruction | Carry out a verified instruction without changing its meaning | Records custodian dispatches the fixed package |
| Administer | Operate approved configuration or access processes | Technical user disable; not report approval |

Approval records must identify the object/version, scope, actor/role, time, decision, conditions and evidence/hash. Relevant changes make current applicability stale without rewriting historical decisions. Delegations require scope, dates, rationale and approval. These are target server-side controls from GOV-01–04; the standalone HTML only illustrates selected paths.

## 5. Detailed user-role views

### R01. Relationship owner

**Homepage:** Relationship workspace. Move a prospect forward without bypassing acceptance.

**Source basis:** §2.1, LC-01–05, LC-07, LC-08, UX-03.

**Data visibility:** Assigned leads and relationship summaries; contact, service, commercial proposal and renewal information. No default access to internal working papers or restricted compliance evidence.

**Views and feature areas**

1. Lead pipeline and duplicate-review queue.
2. Discovery notes, entity scope and service brief.
3. Proposal preparation and internal-review request.
4. Client relationship summary and communication history.
5. Renewal opportunities and commercial follow-up.

**Privileges and permitted operations**

- Create and update assigned inquiries and discovery drafts.
- Prepare proposal revisions and request pricing review.
- Advance commercial stages when the relevant conditions are met.
- View acceptance outcome and conditions relevant to commercial follow-up.

**Restrictions**

- Cannot accept a client professionally or clear KYC/independence concerns.
- Cannot approve an audit conclusion, change the client ledger or issue an audit report.
- Cannot treat proposal acceptance as engagement activation.

**Handoff:** Relationship owner → onboarding coordinator → compliance reviewer → engagement partner; approved commercial terms return to the authorized client signatory.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Create a synthetic inquiry, inspect/advance permitted commercial stages, prepare a proposal for independent review, view relationship summaries and record a renewal follow-up. Binding contracts, full duplicate merging and real communications remain outside the demonstration.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `acquisition`, `client-summary`, `services`, `renewal`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R02. Onboarding coordinator

**Homepage:** Onboarding workspace. Collect the right information. Keep every decision attributable.

**Source basis:** §2.1, LC-04, LC-06–07, LC-11.

**Data visibility:** Assigned onboarding cases, factual profile fields, evidence-receipt checklist, signature status and access requests. Restricted compliance conclusions are outside the general onboarding view.

**Views and feature areas**

1. Profile and ownership-document collection checklist.
2. Missing-evidence requests and reminders.
3. Terms/signature collection status.
4. Client invitation request register.
5. Submit a collected file for compliance review.

**Privileges and permitted operations**

- Collect and correct factual drafts and record evidence-receipt metadata.
- Request missing documents and obtain authorized signatures.
- Submit an intake case for separate checking.
- Prepare portal invitation requests without granting staff authority.

**Restrictions**

- Cannot approve the assessment they prepared.
- Cannot mark received documents as verified solely because they were uploaded.
- Cannot grant professional roles or override outstanding acceptance conditions.

**Handoff:** Coordinator submits the collected information to compliance; manager verifies entity/contact mapping; partner owns final acceptance.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Edit the four-group collection checklist, save it or submit CASE-003 to compliance, and prepare a scoped client invitation request. The full source questionnaire is available as reference; checking a receipt box does not actually verify a person or document.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `intake`, `client-summary`, `invitations`, `renewal`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R03. Compliance officer

**Homepage:** Compliance workspace. Review identity, ownership and conflicts in a restricted channel.

**Source basis:** §2.1, LC-04, Q09, Q38–40, LC-08, §17.7.

**Data visibility:** Explicitly assigned restricted acceptance/continuance cases, relevant identity/ownership evidence and conflicts/AML assessment. Client-facing projections exclude restricted assessments.

**Views and feature areas**

1. Restricted case review and evidence sufficiency.
2. Ownership, conflict and applicable AML checklists.
3. Enhanced-due-diligence and clarification routing.
4. Reasoned recommendation / hold / decline recommendation.
5. Annual or event-triggered reassessment.

**Privileges and permitted operations**

- Record specialist verification and a scoped compliance disposition.
- Request clarification or enhanced review.

**Restrictions**

- Cannot substitute a compliance recommendation for partner acceptance.
- Cannot override a confirmed prohibition with a risk score.
- Cannot publish restricted reporting or investigation information to clients by default.
- No automatic authority to file a suspicious-activity report.

**Handoff:** Compliance recommendation and unresolved conditions → engagement partner. Jurisdiction-specific restricted reporting remains separately authorized.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Open a submitted synthetic restricted case; record reviewed-check declarations, a rationale and an acceptance/decline recommendation or hold. Acceptance recommendations require the listed checks. No external screening or regulatory submission occurs.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `compliance`, `renewal`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R04. Engagement partner / lead auditor

**Homepage:** Partner workspace. Own the professional decision—not a shortcut around the gates.

**Source basis:** §2.1, GOV-01–04, LC-04, LC-10, LC-23–26.

**Data visibility:** Assigned engagements, significant judgments, reviewed working papers, final financial packages, acceptance outcomes, representations and quality-review status. A role title does not grant every client or unrestricted compliance access.

**Views and feature areas**

1. Acceptance and continuance decisions.
2. Scope, independence and significant-judgment review.
3. Completion and report-readiness dashboard.
4. Exact-package professional authorization.
5. Required EQR status and controlled issue/reissue.

**Privileges and permitted operations**

- Decide client/service acceptance after required clearances.
- Approve significant audit strategy/materiality judgments.
- Approve the exact report/conclusion within signing authority.
- Authorize release only after management approval and required quality gates.

**Restrictions**

- Cannot approve management responsibilities on behalf of the client.
- Cannot complete EQR for the same engagement as its partner.
- Cannot override a legal/professional prohibition or unresolved substantive blocker.
- Cannot rewrite issued history, inherit authority from system-admin access, or bypass independence.

**Handoff:** Partner authorization + required EQR → authorized dispatch → records assembly; rework returns through affected independent reviews.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Make the separate partner decision after compliance; review package gates; authorize a version-specific simulated package, prepare one release event and record dispatch; demonstrate continuance and creation of a new-period draft. Real methodology, signing and provider evidence remain absent.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `acceptance`, `clients`, `engagements`, `accounting`, `audit`, `reviews`, `delivery`, `continuance`, `services`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R05. Engagement manager

**Homepage:** Manager workspace. Coordinate delivery, resolve blockers, and review the whole file.

**Source basis:** §2.1, LC-03, LC-09, LC-21, BIL-01–04.

**Data visibility:** Assigned engagement scope, tasks, staff, budget and timetables; permitted financial/workpaper versions and review history. Commercial approval is limited to separately authorized limits.

**Views and feature areas**

1. Team ownership, deadlines and workload queue.
2. Scope and engagement-plan review.
3. Accounting/audit progress and unresolved matters.
4. Manager completion and summary-memorandum review.
5. Proposal/invoice review requests and approved time.

**Privileges and permitted operations**

- Create draft engagements and assign work within approved scope.
- Review significant balances, file consistency and manager completion.
- Return affected areas for rework.
- Review commercial drafts or time within a separate approved authority.

**Restrictions**

- Cannot independently approve work materially prepared by the same individual.
- Cannot approve client management matters or substitute for partner/EQR.
- Cannot reduce necessary procedures to conceal budget overrun.
- Cannot change signed scope without an authorized change request.

**Handoff:** Senior-cleared work → manager review → client management clearance → partner/EQR; staffing and commercial exceptions follow their own approvals.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Inspect assigned engagements and review queues; change task due dates with reasons; review another person’s time; respond to EQR concerns; review invoice/proposal drafts; and record manager completion over the selected package. The sample retains each task’s professional function; replacing it with a different person of the same qualified function is a production requirement, not fully simulated here.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `clients`, `engagements`, `team`, `documents`, `accounting`, `audit`, `reviews`, `commercial-review`, `my-time`, `services`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R06. Preparer / associate

**Homepage:** Preparation workspace. Prepare, reconcile and respond—then hand over an exact version.

**Source basis:** §2.1, LC-13–20, AUD-01–04, GOV-02.

**Data visibility:** Assigned client/engagement work, required evidence, source datasets, draft calculations and own review responses. Not every firm client or restricted compliance case.

**Views and feature areas**

1. My preparation queue and document dependencies.
2. Trial-balance import, mapping and reconciliation drafts.
3. Adjustment proposal and supporting schedules.
4. Audit procedures, workpapers and evidence links.
5. Review responses and time entries.

**Privileges and permitted operations**

- Create or revise permitted drafts and supply evidence.

- Cannot approve or clear own work or review responses.
- Cannot authorize management changes or select the audit opinion.
- Cannot issue a report, mark a hold resolved or delete posted/issued records.
- Cannot post to the firm ledger merely because client data is assigned.

**Handoff:** Preparer → senior reviewer; rework creates a new version and can stale dependent approvals.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Use the original accounting/workpaper demonstration: bounded synthetic CSV import, mapping, basic reporting adjustments, workpaper submission, review responses and package rebuilding. Log own time. This is not an operational client ledger or a complete financial-statement engine.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `documents`, `accounting`, `audit`, `reviews`, `my-time`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R07. Senior reviewer

**Homepage:** Review workspace. Clear only the evidence and version you actually reviewed.

**Source basis:** §2.1, LC-13–18, LC-20, GOV-01–04.

**Data visibility:** Work assigned for independent review, exact submissions, source/calculation lineage and review-point history. Scope does not expand through links or exports.

**Views and feature areas**

1. My independent review queue.
2. Import, mapping and reconciliation checks.
3. Version-linked review comments and required actions.
4. Response comparison and independent clearance.
5. Escalation to manager and stale-work reminders.

**Privileges and permitted operations**

- Approve applicable technical checks under assigned authority.
- Raise, clear or reopen owned review points or formally reassigned points.
- Return work for a precise evidence or calculation correction.
- Record a supported conclusion over the reviewed version.

**Restrictions**

- Cannot clear a response they prepared or approve their own draft.
- Cannot grant management/partner/EQR sign-off by clearing a review point.
- Cannot hide evidence limitations by marking a task complete.
- Cannot edit history or silently change the submitted version.

**Handoff:** Reviewed version and point dispositions → manager. Significant unresolved matters escalate rather than disappear.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Review the displayed financial work, approve the demonstration mapping, perform the new independent adjustment technical review, raise/clear/reopen review points, and review workpaper submissions. The sample uses a separate named reviewer; real qualifications and assignments are not verified.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `documents`, `accounting`, `audit`, `reviews`, `my-time`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R08. Engagement quality reviewer

**Homepage:** Quality review workspace. Independently evaluate significant judgments and raise concerns.

**Source basis:** §2.1, LC-23, G09, GOV-03.

**Data visibility:** Specifically assigned quality-review engagements and required significant-judgment evidence. Access is separate from the engagement preparation team; no general client portfolio.

**Views and feature areas**

1. Assigned EQR case and eligibility confirmation.
2. Selected significant judgments and exact package versions.
3. Restricted concern register and responses.
4. Record independent completion with rationale.
5. Changed-version impact and renewed-review status.

**Privileges and permitted operations**

- Inspect the evidence and judgments required by the assigned EQR.
- Raise a concern and evaluate the response.
- Record EQR completion after required concerns are resolved.
- Request additional work without preparing it for the team.

**Restrictions**

- Cannot act as preparer or engagement partner for the same EQR.
- Cannot replace management approval or partner opinion responsibility.
- Cannot sign off unresolved concerns or use stale package evidence.
- Cannot expand own client/engagement access.

**Handoff:** Independent EQR completion → partner release readiness; any subsequent relevant change requires impact assessment.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Record a simulated eligibility declaration, add and evaluate significant-judgment concerns, read a manager response and record independent EQR completion for the package revision. No editing of the underlying accounting or workpapers is offered in this role.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `quality`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R09. Client administrator

**Homepage:** Client administration. Coordinate your people and requests within your authorized entities.

**Source basis:** §2.1, LC-07, DATA-04, UX-03.

**Data visibility:** Only explicitly authorized client entities/engagements, contributor assignments, invitations and published client-facing records. No sibling entity by corporate email domain.

**Views and feature areas**

1. Client engagement and request overview.
2. Contact nominations and limited client-role requests.
3. PBC responsibility assignment.

**Restrictions**

- Cannot grant firm-staff roles, expand entity scope or self-promote to signatory.
- Cannot approve financial statements merely because they administer the portal.
- Cannot read internal audit notes, risk assessments or firm economics.
- Signatory nomination is not verified signing authority.

**Handoff:** Client admin nomination → firm onboarding/access verification → approved scoped grant. Contributors and signatories retain distinct responsibilities.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Nominate a client finance contributor or a proposed signatory for the existing entity; inspect request status; assign a PBC responsibility to an existing synthetic contributor; view client-facing status and published deliverables. Nominations stay pending until the separate administrator verification demonstration. Contact revocation and provider provisioning are target requirements, not completed integrations.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `portal`, `client-team`, `client-requests`, `client-deliverables`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R10. Client finance contributor

**Homepage:** Client finance workspace. Supply evidence and factual answers without making firm decisions.

**Source basis:** §2.1, LC-11–12, LC-13, LC-22.

**Data visibility:** Assigned requests for Example Trading Entity in the demo; relevant query responses and expressly published deliverables. Internal reviewer discussions are excluded.

**Views and feature areas**

1. My document requests and due dates.
2. Trial-balance/GL/support upload metadata.

- Cannot view other clients or unrestricted internal workpapers.

**Handoff:** Contributor submission → administrative validation → technical adequacy review; answered does not mean cleared.

**Demonstrated functionality:** View only assigned synthetic PBC requests; provide a built-in sample or select a local file whose metadata/hash is recorded; replace a submission; ask a client-facing question; and inspect delivered client packages. Original file bytes are not persisted or transmitted.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `portal`, `client-requests`, `client-deliverables`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R11. Client authorized signatory

**Homepage:** Management approval workspace. Approve your responsibilities and accounts—not the auditor’s opinion.

**Source basis:** §2.1, LC-06, LC-17, LC-22–24, GOV-03.

**Data visibility:** Verified management-approval scope, exact presented terms, proposed adjustments, reviewed draft statements, representations and published reports for the authorized entity.

**Views and feature areas**

1. Engagement terms and authority status.

- Provide required representations and acknowledge delivered files.

**Restrictions**

- Cannot select or approve the auditor’s independent opinion.
- Cannot clear internal review points or view private firm deliberations.
- Cannot approve an old version as approval of the new version.
- Acknowledgement alone is not account approval or a legal digital signature.

**Handoff:** Reviewed package → management signatory → partner and required EQR; changed accounts return to independent review and fresh management approval.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Read the presented manager-reviewed draft; record terms acceptance, an adjustment decision after technical review, an explicit management approval and a separate responsibility attestation; acknowledge delivered packages. No actual signature or legal representation letter is created.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `portal`, `client-approvals`, `client-deliverables`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R12. Billing officer

**Homepage:** Billing workspace. Keep commercial decisions in the firm’s books, not the client’s.

**Source basis:** §2.1, BIL-01–04, DAT-04, LC-24.

**Data visibility:** Authorized firm invoices, time/expenses, bill-to contacts, collections and ledger references. No automatic access to client TB/GL, audit workpapers or restricted acceptance records.

- Cannot use fee settlement to approve or alter audit conclusions.
- Cannot approve own fee exceptions or bypass commercial limits.
- Cannot delete posted invoices or release confidential working papers.

**Handoff:** Billing draft → authorized manager/commercial approver → billing issue/collection. Professional closure remains separate.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Prepare and submit a synthetic firm invoice, wait for independent commercial review, issue the approved draft, record a bounded receipt and prepare a credit/write-off/refund request. Exceptions stay pending; no source ledger or bank account is posted.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `billing`, `commercial-requests`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R13. Records administrator

**Homepage:** Records workspace. Preserve the issued file and administer its controlled lifecycle.

**Source basis:** §2.1, LC-24–26, G11–12, NFR-08, NFR-10.

**Data visibility:** Authorized issued packages, assembly manifests, approved export scopes and hold/disposition metadata. No preparation or editing authority over signed workpapers.

**Views and feature areas**

1. Issued-package assembly and verification queue.
2. Archive manifest and protection status.
3. Legal-hold register and blocked disposition requests.
4. Authorized handover and export requests.

- Cannot delete records under a hold or infer deletion from termination.
- Cannot self-authorize a restricted full-file client export.
- Cannot equate a requested retention label with observed protection.

**Handoff:** Authorized release → records assembly → protection verification; disposition and handover require separate approved scope and recipients.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Select an issued demonstration package, record authorized dispatch, inspect/export its existing manifest, assemble an archive marker, record a synthetic hold instruction and prepare a handover/disposition request. An active hold blocks the disposition demonstration. No file is deleted, transmitted or protected by a live records provider.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `records`, `handover`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

### R14. System administrator

**Homepage:** System administration. Operate the platform without acquiring professional signing rights.

**Source basis:** §2.1, GOV-04, ARC-11–13, NFR-01–06, NFR-08.

- Cannot broaden own scope or bypass required authorization.
- Infrastructure privileges still require separately controlled access and monitoring.

**Handoff:** Approved authority/access request → technical provisioning → effective-access verification. Recovery work does not authorize financial or professional decisions.

**Demonstrated functionality:** Inspect the fourteen synthetic persona states, disable/re-enable a persona’s frontend business actions, verify a scoped client-role nomination with additional signatory checks, and record a technical configuration draft. Connections stay off; fixed demo personas are not new real accounts and configuration drafts do not apply tenant changes.

**Navigation implemented:** `overview`, `administration`, `access-requests`, `operations`, `role-guide`, `privileges`, `requirements`.

## 6. Activity-by-role privilege register

This register is the proposed permission mapping used by the visualization. An entry means eligibility only. It never grants all clients, all entities, all records, or unconditional approval. The same information appears interactively in the prototype’s permissions matrix. Some target capabilities are shown as reference rather than fully exercised actions.

| Activity | Eligible role(s) | Required condition / boundary |
|---|---|---|

| Submit a proposal for review | Relationship owner | Current discovery/scope and separate pricing review. |
| Review commercial proposal | Engagement manager | Assigned commercial authority; never own prepared draft. |
| Collect factual intake evidence | Onboarding coordinator | Only the assigned intake case; received is not verified. |
| Submit an intake case | Onboarding coordinator | Complete required collection checks; checker must differ. |
| Record compliance disposition | Compliance officer | Assigned restricted case, evidence and rationale; not partner acceptance. |
| Accept / continue professional scope | Engagement partner / lead auditor | Current independent clearances, conditions and permissible service. |

| Propose reporting adjustment | Preparer / associate | Balanced reporting proposal with evidence and scope. |
| Review reporting adjustment | Senior reviewer | Not the preparer; evidence and exact proposed version. |
| Authorize management adjustment | Client authorized signatory | Verified signatory; technical review first; no firm-ledger posting. |
| Prepare workpaper / evidence | Preparer / associate | Assigned procedure, recorded sources and conclusions. |
| Review submitted workpaper | Senior reviewer | Independent and assigned; preserve exact submission. |

| Dispatch authorized package | Engagement partner / lead auditor; Records administrator | Approved recipients/artifacts only; no content substitution. |
| Assemble completed file | Records administrator | Authorized issued/delivered artifacts; no signed-content editing. |
| Record authorized hold instruction | Records administrator | Instruction and scope required; no automatic hold release. |
| Request controlled disposition | Records administrator | No active hold; expiry and separate approval remain required. |
| Nominate a client contact / role | Client administrator | Existing entity only; signatory nomination requires firm verification. |
| Prepare firm invoice draft | Billing officer | Office/firm ledger context; source, fees and scope required. |
| Review invoice / fee draft | Engagement manager | Separate commercial authority and independent reviewer. |
| Issue approved firm invoice | Billing officer | Approved current commercial draft; not an audit release. |
| Record demo firm receipt | Billing officer | Valid issued invoice; positive bounded allocation; separate bank verification. |
| Record own work time | Preparer / associate; Senior reviewer; Engagement manager | Own entry; approval must be independent. |
| Review staff time | Engagement manager | Assigned engagement and a different individual. |
| Process an approved access request | System administrator | Scope verification and approved authority; not self-granting professional power. |
| Prepare technical configuration change | System administrator | Approved configuration and separate change control; no live secrets in demo. |
| Decide annual continuance | Engagement partner / lead auditor | Current-period assessment, required clearances and authority. |
| Prepare authorized handover request | Records administrator | Client-owned versus firm documents distinguished; recipient authority required. |

## 7. Visibility and confidentiality matrix

| Information | Primary permitted view | Explicit exclusions |
|---|---|---|
| Lead / commercial proposal | Assigned relationship staff; manager with commercial review authority | Client users receive only permitted client-facing proposal material |
| Factual onboarding information | Assigned onboarding staff, relevant compliance checker, authorized client respondent | No unrestricted firm-wide identity-document exposure |
| Restricted compliance assessment | Assigned compliance officer; other access only through approved purpose/scope | Not ordinary client portal content; not generic commercial notes |
| TB, GL, reporting adjustments | Assigned accounting/audit team | Billing and systems administration do not receive default business-content access |
| Workpapers and internal review notes | Assigned preparer/reviewer/manager/partner; EQR only within required scope | Excluded from client portal unless separately authorized |
| Reviewed draft financial statements | Authorized management signatory after the proper presentation gate | Client administrator/contributor are not automatically signatories |
| Released client report | Authorized recipients after issue/delivery | Internal archive is not automatically a client deliverable |
| EQR concerns | Eligible quality reviewer and the team members responsible for responses | Quality reviewer does not prepare the underlying work |
| Firm billing / time / fee exceptions | Assigned billing and commercial-review roles | Does not change the client’s ledger or audit opinion |
| Records/hold/disposition metadata | Authorized records personnel | No alteration of issued content or destruction under hold |
| User, job, backup and integration metadata | Authorized system operations | No secret values or uncontrolled professional authority |

Client financial contributors in this demo are restricted to the selected entity’s assigned requests. All three client personas are restricted to the fictional Example Trading Entity. Staff demo assignments differ by role. These are synthetic fixture choices; real assignments must be persisted, independently authorized and checked on the server.

## 8. Cross-role workflows to demonstrate

### 8.1 New-client acceptance

`Relationship owner → Onboarding coordinator → Compliance officer → Engagement partner → Client authorized signatory → Authorized access operations`

In the role simulator, use CASE-003. The coordinator completes the four collection groups and submits. Compliance records an independent recommendation or hold. Partner acceptance fails before the required clearance. Signed terms, real evidence and actual engagement activation remain separate production obligations.

### 8.2 Client access and evidence

`Client administrator nominates/assigns → firm verifies scope and authority → Client finance contributor submits → Senior/manager checks adequacy`

Use Client administrator → Contacts & access to nominate a proposed signatory. The nomination remains pending. System administrator → Access requests requires identity, entity and separate signatory-authority declarations before the local request can become approved. It does not create a real account. On Document requests, the contributor can supply a built-in sample; the client never receives the technical “accept evidence” command.

### 8.3 Reporting adjustment

`Preparer proposes → Senior reviewer checks → Client signatory accepts/rejects → reporting layer reflects the authorized decision → affected review is repeated`

Prepare a revised illustrative depreciation amount in Accounting. The new adjustment stays Management pending. The signatory cannot approve it before the Senior reviewer records the technical review. Management’s choice affects the local reporting example only. It never posts into the practice’s own ledger or an external client accounting system.

### 8.4 Workpaper to exact-version release

`Preparer response → Senior clearance → Preparer rebuild → Manager completion → Management approval/representations → Partner conclusion + required EQR → Partner issue → Records dispatch/assembly`

Use Example Trading Entity. Respond to RN-001 and RN-002 as Preparer; clear each as Senior reviewer. Rebuild as Preparer. Record manager package review, respond to the EQR concern as Manager, then approve the presented accounts and the separate responsibility attestation as Client authorized signatory. Record partner authorization. As EQR, declare eligibility, independently clear the responded concern and complete the exact-version review. The Partner may then prepare and issue the frozen demo package. Records administrator can dispatch/assemble it. A later source change stales current approvals while preserving the issued preview.

### 8.5 Commercial billing

`Billing officer prepares/submits → Manager with commercial authority reviews → Billing officer issues → Receipt allocated → independent reconciliation in production`

The demo denies billing self-review and prevents issue before independent commercial approval. A synthetic receipt changes the firm invoice balance only; it does not modify client financial-statement balances. Credits, refunds and write-offs are request-only examples pending separate authorization.

### 8.6 Records and exit

`Approved issue → authorized dispatch → assembly → retention/hold verification → approved renewal, handover or disposition`

The records role can record an authorized synthetic hold instruction. A subsequent disposition request is blocked while the hold is active. Hold release, actual deletion, actual delivery, provider locks, real termination and externally verified access revocation are not implemented by the demo.

## 9. Common screen behaviors

Each role homepage includes its name/purpose, scope explanation, next-action queue, feature areas, eligible operations, explicit restrictions and a handoff panel. Navigation includes only that role’s proposed workspace routes. Restricted direct route requests return to the role homepage. Client previews omit internal record details and other clients from visible data. Search uses permitted role routes and scoped staff engagement results. Disabled actions explain that the current role is not permitted.

The **Design reference** area intentionally allows the presenter to inspect all role definitions, the 44-activity matrix and the source requirements. Those are design/reference documents, not production client data. The global demo persona selector intentionally changes the simulated user; it must not be copied into a production authorization model.

## 10. What remains a production implementation requirement

The source requires server-side access enforcement and real authority checks. This frontend does not provide them. Production work must implement and prove the source’s identity/session lifecycle, scoped queries and commands, individual maker/checker checks, confidential document access, exact-version concurrency, append-only approval evidence, idempotent operations, retention/holds, effective access revocation and recovery. Role-based menu visibility alone is never sufficient.

This deliverable does not add a backend, database, new production permission service, Microsoft integration, complete ledger, statutory reporting engine, statistical sampling engine, qualified-methodology approval, legal signature, filing connector or secure records store. It does not claim a role catalogue completes all service-specific modules in §17. Special services still need their own inputs, approved methods, workflows, outputs and acceptance evidence.

No separate “all-powerful super-admin,” regulator login, leadership login or specialist role is invented here. The 14 source roles are preserved. Additional or combined roles require a separately approved mapping that retains scope and independence restrictions.

## 11. Verification and evidence boundaries

Browser-local checks cover all 113 declared role/route combinations, desktop/mobile body overflow, selected forbidden routes, absence of unrelated client record content in the three client views, role-ineligible commands, the acceptance chain, client signatory nomination checks, billing review, review/rework/approval, EQR, one release event, delivery, archive simulation, legal-hold blocking, stale approvals and demo user disable behavior.

Actual results are in `test-results.json`, bound to the tested HTML SHA-256. The suite uses Chromium with in-memory document rendering and synthetic single-browser state. It is not a penetration test, a live-tenant test, a multi-user authorization test, a server-concurrency test or a professional acceptance certificate. Browser-origin persistence, actual downloads/printing and provider behavior are not verified by this suite.

For production, map each enabled source requirement to actual code/command, scoped records, positive/negative/retry/concurrency tests, observed evidence, and named reviewer. The source’s AT-01–46 bank and detailed field requirements remain independently applicable; the larger count of frontend checks does not replace them.

## 12. Files and usage

- `AuditSphere_All_Role_Portals_v2.html`: standalone browser visualization. Open locally; no installation or service account is required.
- `AuditSphere_All_User_Roles_Features_and_Privileges.md`: this source-grounded guide.
- `AuditSphere_All_Role_Portals_v2_Source.zip`: source, build script, role/activity configuration, requirements reference and test evidence.

Use only synthetic data. Browser storage is editable and may be unavailable in some environments; when available, v2 uses a separate localStorage key from the earlier prototype. Local reset affects only v2 demo state. The original HTML and original source document are unchanged.
