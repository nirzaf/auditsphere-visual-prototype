# AuditSphere Visual Prototype — Current Supported Scope (VP-001)

Version 1.0 · 2026-09-23 · `docs/prototype/scope.md`

This is the single visible supported-product scope. Anything outside it is not
offered in navigation, setup, gates, catalogues, templates or release prerequisites.

## In scope (browser-only interactive prototype)

Practice dashboard · CRM & client management · leads & opportunities · proposals &
engagements · jobs, one-level tasks/subtasks, manually applied job templates ·
internal notes/mentions (in-app notices only) · SharePoint-first document library
(canonical) · optional bounded OneDrive selection/import · basic outgoing mail
simulation + manual incoming-call/meeting/email notes · client portal (explicitly
shared records only) · PBC request/response/acceptance loop · time, versioned
budgets, invoice drafts from explicit sources, independent review, local issue,
credit notes, offline receipts/allocations, as-of aging · import-first accounting
(TB/GL intake, mappings, journals, reconciliations, statements, packages) ·
bounded group consolidation (perimeter, pinned packages, FX table, eliminations) ·
acceptance, planning/materiality, risks/programs, fieldwork, populations/sampling,
workpapers, evidence catalogue, findings, review points, revision-bound approvals
with per-engagement EQR, completion/release candidate + dispatch simulation,
amendment lineage, logical archive index · deterministic reports · scoped search ·
firm administration · simulated M365 setup (Entra concept, Graph transport concept,
SharePoint, Exchange basic mail, optional OneDrive).

Fixed demo clock: `asOfDate = 2026-09-23`. Money in integer minor units per record
with currency retained; time in integer minutes; line-level rounding then sum.

## Hard exclusions (never offered, never gated)

All application AI/agents/integrations/Copilot/summaries/semantic-vector search ·
mobile apps · online payments/gateways/bank feeds · eSignatures/signature capture ·
tax preparation/filing/organisers · payroll execution/administration ·
workflow/close automation (rules engines, schedulers, reminders, recurring
tasks/jobs/invoices, auto-renewals) · advanced email (inbox/Triage, sync, routing,
email-to-task, polling, Outlook add-in) · non-M365 business integrations (Google,
Dropbox, Xero/QBO, Slack, Zapier, SMTP/Resend, etc.) · Microsoft Purview in any
form (no adapter, no gate, no prerequisite) · SOC 2 certification / bespoke
encryption feature work.

Allowed ordinary behaviour: deterministic calculations, text search, validation,
arithmetic, content hashes, HTTPS hosting, escaping, access-view checks.

## Simulation honesty rules

- Microsoft surfaces are simulations: `liveConnected` is always false. No OAuth,
  credentials, tokens, tenant provisioning, or external calls.
- Issued invoices change local demo records; nothing sends a demand for payment.
- Approvals record human decisions; nothing is an electronic signature.
- Uploads persist metadata + hash only; original bytes are in-session and must be
  reselected after reload. Synthetic fixtures are downloadable and labelled.
- Client projections show explicitly shared records only.

## Historical source

Predecessor artefacts (`base-app.js`, `role-views.js`, `AuditSphere_All_Role_Portals_v2.html`,
old standalone builds, old test counts) may mention excluded products. Where shown
deliberately they carry the label “Historical source — not current product scope”
and enable no business action. The current-scope views above are the default.
