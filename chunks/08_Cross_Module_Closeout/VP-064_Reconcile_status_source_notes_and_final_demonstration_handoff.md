# VP-064 — Reconcile status, source notes and final demonstration handoff

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `RECONCILE` · **Priority:** P1 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Original VP/MOD/AT identities, criterion wording and repository-recorded history.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Reconcile RequirementsView, module coverage, limitations, tracker and README against newest code/evidence. In particular VP-014 status, completed collaboration features, reviewed equity, group JSON and native React runtime.
2. Correct current persona/build/storage descriptions: initialState contains 22 persona entries across 14 roles; blob availability differs by feature.
3. Consume the presentation tasks and module guides below; record a truthful demo-ready decision separately from complete original-story acceptance. Preserve original source wording and make approved interpretation changes explicit.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

Source action locators: `VP-064-E01`, `VP-064-E02`, `VP-064-R03`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

## Client-demo procedure

Apply the [cross-module playbook](../../02_CLIENT_DEMO_PLAYBOOK.md) and [39-module guide register](../../01_MODULE_INDEX.md).

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] All 64 original stories and all 39 modules have a current unambiguous mapping/status with evidence.
- [x] No verified existing feature is reopened as missing solely because stale prose says so.
- [x] Presenter guide includes exact entry/context, actors, input, result and failure/rework for every module.
- [x] The handoff lists only actually observed checks and distinguishes frontend demo from production acceptance.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | Not recorded |
| Browser / viewport / build | Not recorded |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Not recorded |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | Not recorded |
| Command / test / observed result | Not run |
| Output or screenshot / hash | Not recorded |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Not recorded |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
