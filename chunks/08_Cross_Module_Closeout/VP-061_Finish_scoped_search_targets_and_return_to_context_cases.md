# VP-061 — Finish scoped search targets and return-to-context cases

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P2 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Existing exact task/workpaper/contact/finding/PBC navigation and scoped filters.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Reconcile already-added target fixes with old pending descriptions.
2. Run all permitted persona/grant/type combinations, including archived/unavailable targets and grant revocation.
3. Verify record highlighting, engagement selection and return filters; preserve deterministic text/metadata search.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-061, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-061)

Source action locators: `VP-061-E01`, `VP-061-E02`, `VP-061-R03`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

- [`src/components/modules/ClientDetailView.tsx`](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/src/components/modules/ClientDetailView.tsx)

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-17 — Search & Centralized Client View](../../modules/MOD-17_Search_Centralized_Client_View.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] Every result opens the correct specific authorized record.
- [x] Search/count/filter options never reveal an ungranted record.
- [x] Unavailable/archived results are labeled and cannot bypass availability guards.
- [x] No embeddings, AI, indexing service or duplicate record store is added.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c + committed base |
| Browser / viewport / build | Chrome E2E + Shell search inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Client persona searching; staff returning to context via results |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | E2E "AT-50/VP-061: client search excludes internal activity and finds shared documents"; VP-003-AC02 journey (global-search navigation verifies Stay/Save/Discard) |
| Command / test / observed result | Scoped search targets only permitted entities (no title/snippet/count leakage); historical requirements text not indexed; return-to-context safe across unsaved drafts |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - 83/83 E2E incl. AT-50/VP-061; Shell.tsx search filters by visibleClientIds/visibleEngagementIds and excludes internal record types from client scope |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
