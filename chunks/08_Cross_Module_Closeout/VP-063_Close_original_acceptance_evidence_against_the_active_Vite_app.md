# VP-063 — Close original acceptance evidence against the active Vite app

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P1 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Existing 172 unit / 74 E2E repository-recorded results and all useful regressions.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Map all 256 original VP criteria and 54 original AT journeys to exact assertions, fixtures, commits and actual outcomes; additional AT labels do not renumber the contract.
2. Run missing positive/negative/scope/stale/rework/reload/empty/error subcases; change code only for reproduced defects.
3. Keep no-provider-egress checks and genuine artifact parsing; report tool/bootstrap failures honestly. Use actual package scripts, not an assumed test framework.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-063, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-063)

Source action locators: `VP-063-E01`, `VP-063-E02`, `VP-063-E03`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

## Client-demo procedure

Apply the [cross-module playbook](../../02_CLIENT_DEMO_PLAYBOOK.md) and [39-module guide register](../../01_MODULE_INDEX.md).

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [ ] Every original criterion is accounted for as observed pass, fail, blocked or not run with a precise reason.
- [ ] A test-name/AT mention never substitutes for matching expected outcomes.
- [ ] Current-app tests use the actual Vite build and isolated synthetic data.
- [ ] No live M365/email/payment/AI or production AuditSphere action is performed.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | Not recorded |
| Browser / viewport / build | Not recorded |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Not recorded |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | Not recorded |
| Command / test / observed result | Not run |
| Output or screenshot / hash | Not recorded |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Not recorded |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
