# VP-046 — Complete group-output criterion sign-off and presenter packaging

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P1 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Watermarked digest-verified JSON group artifacts with separate Partner review and same-currency/FX browser evidence already exist.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Do not rebuild completed VP-046-E02/R01; reconcile remaining original criteria against exact tests.
2. Demonstrate prepare→independent review→download→input change→stale block→fresh output.
3. Label the supported JSON format accurately and show all component/rate/elimination lineage; propose a visual summary only where needed for client comprehension, not as a new engine.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-26 — Consolidation](../../modules/MOD-26_Consolidation.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [ ] Artifact bytes/hash and permitted group inputs agree.
- [ ] A different eligible person reviews the exact current fingerprint.
- [ ] Post-review source/rate/perimeter/elimination change blocks stale download.
- [ ] Unsupported method or unavailable figure is explicit; no false group XLSX/DOCX/PDF claim.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | Not recorded |
| Browser / viewport / build | Not recorded |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Not recorded |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | Not recorded |
| Command / test / observed result | Not run |
| Output or screenshot / hash | Not recorded |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Not recorded |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
