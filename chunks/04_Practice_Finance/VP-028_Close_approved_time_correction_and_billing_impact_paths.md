# VP-028 — Close approved-time correction and billing-impact paths

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P2 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Working time draft/submit/return/approve/correction lifecycle.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Exercise date boundaries, positive minutes, job/task scope and all effective-total projections.
2. Correct approved time already used by a draft or issued invoice; show billing impact without rewriting the invoice.
3. Compare effective time, WIP, budget and reservation history after correction.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-028, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-028)

Source action locators: `VP-028-E01`, `VP-028-E02`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

- [`src/components/modules/TimeTrackingView.tsx`](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/src/components/modules/TimeTrackingView.tsx)

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-12 — Time Tracking](../../modules/MOD-12_Time_Tracking.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [ ] Self-review and invalid minutes/date/scope reject without partial changes.
- [ ] Correction preserves approved source/rate history.
- [ ] Already-consumed time cannot be invoiced again by correction.
- [ ] Each affected view clearly distinguishes approved, submitted and superseded time.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | Not recorded |
| Browser / viewport / build | Not recorded |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Not recorded |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | Not recorded |
| Command / test / observed result | Not run |
| Output or screenshot / hash | Not recorded |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Not recorded |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
