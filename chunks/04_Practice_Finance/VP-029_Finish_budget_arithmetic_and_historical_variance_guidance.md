# VP-029 — Finish budget arithmetic and historical variance guidance

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P2 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Revisioned budgets and pinned approved-time billing/cost rates.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Run the dedicated 600/660-minute fixture with separate billing and cost assumptions.
2. Compare engagement/job/unallocated budget totals with no double counting.
3. Rehearse rate revision, missing cost and other permitted edit/review/variance states.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-029, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-029)

Source action locators: `VP-029-E01`, `VP-029-E02`, `VP-029-R03`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-13 — Budgets](../../modules/MOD-13_Budgets.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] 600 minutes × QAR 200/hour = QAR 2,000 planned value.
- [x] 660 minutes gives QAR 2,200 billable value and +60-minute variance; QAR 80/hour gives QAR 880 cost.
- [x] Missing cost stays unavailable rather than zero/margin.
- [x] Changing future rates does not rewrite approved historical snapshots or add scheduling automation.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c |
| Browser / viewport / build | Chrome E2E + budget aggregation inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Manager reviewing budgets across engagements and currencies |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | E2E "AT-59/VP-029-E01/E02: aggregates each engagement once using approved time rate snapshots by currency"; playbook fixture arithmetic in calculations tests |
| Command / test / observed result | Planned/billable value, variance and cost per the fixed fixtures; missing cost stays unavailable; future rate changes do not rewrite approved snapshots |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - 83/83 E2E incl. the VP-029 aggregation journey; calculations.test covers the dedicated arithmetic fixtures |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
