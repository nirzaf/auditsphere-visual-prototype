# VP-033 — Close as-of aging boundaries and client statement print content

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P2 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Current/1–30/31–60/61–90/90+ cards, invoice detail and CSV/print controls.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Run all bucket boundaries, due-today, future credits/receipts and reversed allocations at a fixed date.
2. Compare totals with invoice-level drill-down and separate currencies/unallocated funds.
3. Verify browser print content and pagination; do not demand printer-driver certification.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-033, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-033)

Source action locators: `VP-033-E01`, `VP-033-R02`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-15 — Receivables](../../modules/MOD-15_Receivables.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] QAR 1,000 less 100 credit less 300 allocation is QAR 600 in 31–60 at 2026-09-23.
- [x] Due today is Current and future-effective settlement is ignored.
- [x] CSV/print rows equal the selected visible scoped totals.
- [x] Unallocated funds do not reduce an unrelated invoice automatically.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c + committed base |
| Browser / viewport / build | Chrome E2E + calculations.test inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Billing persona at fixed as-of 2026-09-23; client statement export |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | calculations.test (600 outstanding in 31-60; future-effective receipts ignored; unallocated stays); E2E statement CSV/print rows equal scoped totals and exclude another client draft invoice |
| Command / test / observed result | As-of boundaries exact; Current vs 31-60 classification; CSV/print rows equal visible scoped totals; unallocated funds do not reduce unrelated invoices |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - 83/83 E2E incl. the statement CSV/PDF scoped-rows journey; unit tests pin the 1,000/100/300 arithmetic and as-of boundaries |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
