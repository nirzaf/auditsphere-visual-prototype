# VP-024 — Complete accepted-PBC evidence reassessment across recipients

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P1 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Validated durable PBC uploads, response/replacement hashes and self-acceptance denial already have evidence.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Follow an accepted response into adequacy review, linked evidence, procedure and workpaper work.
2. Replace it with reason, preserve prior acceptance/blobs and complete dependent reassessment and independent re-clearance.
3. Repeat across client/entity/recipient boundaries and clarify the durable PBC exception to metadata-only library storage.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-024, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-024)

Source action locators: `VP-024-E02`, `VP-024-R03`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-09 — Client Requests / PBC](../../modules/MOD-09_Client_Requests_PBC.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] Accepted response replacement never silently changes an old evidence/workpaper pin.
- [x] Only the supported current recipient contributes and a distinct eligible person reviews.
- [x] Existing file-size/type/quota regressions remain passing; do not recreate them as wholly missing.
- [x] UI/reload/download statements match the actual PBC storage class.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c + committed base |
| Browser / viewport / build | Chrome E2E + uploadPbcResponse/acceptPbcResponse inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Client_finance uploads and replaces; independent reviewer accepts |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | uploadPbcResponse appends new shared-file version without mutating prior entries (prototypeStore.ts:3284-3353); acceptPbcResponse pins acceptedVersion + acceptanceHistory; E2E AT-23/24 |
| Command / test / observed result | Replacement never silently changes old evidence/workpaper pins; only the named contributor contributes; a distinct eligible person reviews; size/type/quota guards keep passing |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - 83/83 E2E incl. AT-23/24 (replacement after clarification then independent acceptance); requireIndependentActor blocks self-acceptance; validatePbcUpload size/type checks unchanged |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
