# VP-013 — Finish job completion, editing and nonterminal rework

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P2 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Job edit/detail/file/time views and the already-verified task hierarchy/comments/attachment work.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Verify required-child checks for manual job completion, including an empty job.
2. Rehearse permitted return/reopen for nonterminal work states and reasoned cancellation as terminal.
3. Compare linked tasks/documents/time/history before and after cancellation or edit.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-013, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-013)

Source action locators: `VP-013-E01`, `VP-013-R02`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-05 — Jobs & Tasks](../../modules/MOD-05_Jobs_Tasks.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] Open required work blocks job completion.
- [x] A cancelled job cannot be reopened merely to satisfy a generic rework matrix.
- [x] Linked records survive and become appropriately read-only.
- [x] Owner/status/date filters and history persist without granting permissions.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c + committed base |
| Browser / viewport / build | Chrome E2E + updateJob/reassignTask store inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Manager completing a job with an open task; preparer reassignment |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | updateJob guards (prototypeStore.ts:1130-1141); E2E AT-11/AT-12 |
| Command / test / observed result | Open work blocks completion; cancelled job cannot reopen; history recorded; filters persist without new permissions |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - 83/83 E2E incl. AT-11/AT-12; store rejects reopen-after-cancel and premature completion with GuardError; job history events logged |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
