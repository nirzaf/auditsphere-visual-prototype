# VP-015 — Complete job-template acceptance without automated allocation

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P2 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Working template author/publish/revise/apply/retire and duplicate-operation protection.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Exercise all four criteria: title/hierarchy, explicit people/date selection, retired/draft restrictions and cancellation.
2. Verify same operation/body retries versus same operation/changed body rejection.
3. Treat role suggestions as suggestions unless the source explicitly requires more.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-015, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-015)

Source action locators: `VP-015-E01`, `VP-015-R02`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

- [`src/components/modules/JobTemplatesView.tsx`](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/src/components/modules/JobTemplatesView.tsx)

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-06 — Job Templates](../../modules/MOD-06_Job_Templates.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] A published revision produces one new job/task tree with fresh IDs and states.
- [x] No prior approvals/evidence/statuses are copied.
- [x] Existing instantiated jobs never change when the template is revised/retired.
- [x] No recurrence, scheduling or automatic staffing engine is added.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c |
| Browser / viewport / build | Chrome E2E + applyJobTemplate inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Manager applying a published template twice to the same engagement |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | applyJobTemplate(operationId) idempotency; E2E AT-13 and AT-19 |
| Command / test / observed result | One fresh job/task tree with new IDs; no copied approvals/statuses; template revision/retirement leaves applied jobs unchanged; no recurrence engine |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - 83/83 E2E incl. AT-13 ("fresh execution state") and AT-19 ("prepares the same client workspace twice idempotently") |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
