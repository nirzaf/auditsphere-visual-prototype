# VP-027 — Verify shared communication projections and correction history

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P2 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Optional job links and shared communication/client/job views are implemented; do not duplicate records.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Rehearse manual inbound/outbound/call/meeting records with valid dates and scoped attachments.
2. Exercise visibility-change warnings, permissions and correction history.
3. Compare the same record in Communication, Client 360 and job activity, including restricted viewers.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-027, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-027)

Source action locators: `VP-027-E02`, `VP-027-R03`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-07 — Team Collaboration](../../modules/MOD-07_Team_Collaboration.md)
- [MOD-11 — Communications](../../modules/MOD-11_Communications.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] One communication identity and revision appears in each appropriate view.
- [x] Visibility changes require the expected permission and retain previous attribution.
- [x] Client projections omit internal content and attachment identifiers.
- [x] No mailbox sync or scheduled follow-up is implied.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c + committed base |
| Browser / viewport / build | Chrome E2E + communication projection inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Staff logging a communication; client persona viewing portal |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | E2E AT-27; AT-38/AT-40 internal-material exclusion journey |
| Command / test / observed result | One identity/revision per view; visibility changes keep attribution; client projections omit internal content; no mailbox sync implied |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - 83/83 E2E incl. AT-27 and the AT-38/40 exclusion journey; communications render from the single store list with visibility labels |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
