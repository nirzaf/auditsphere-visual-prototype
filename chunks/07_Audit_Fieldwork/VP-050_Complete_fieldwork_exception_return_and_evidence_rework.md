# VP-050 — Complete fieldwork exception return and evidence rework

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P2 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Current procedure execution/submission, evidence/limitation validation and independent clearance.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Execute representative supported procedures through exception→return→new work/evidence→resubmit→clear.
2. Verify edits invalidate only relevant current approval and retain prior work/reviewer history.
3. Use the existing VP-049 template administration rather than creating another program system.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-050, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-050)

Source action locators: `VP-050-R02`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-30 — Audit Fieldwork](../../modules/MOD-30_Audit_Fieldwork.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] Work performed, result, exception/limitation and current evidence are visible per procedure.
- [x] Submit is not clearance; same person cannot clear their own work.
- [x] Replaced evidence/risk input requires relevant reassessment before new clearance.
- [x] Unresolved exceptions remain visible in fieldwork and downstream readiness.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c + committed base |
| Browser / viewport / build | Chrome E2E + fieldwork store inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Preparer records fieldwork; manager clears; preparer reworks after replacement evidence |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | E2E "VP-050: persists procedure fieldwork and requires independent reviewer clearance"; committed fieldwork journeys (reassess and resubmit against replacement evidence; preparer cannot clear own work) |
| Command / test / observed result | Fieldwork exceptions return to the preparer with preserved drafts; evidence rework requires resubmission and independent clearance; same-person denial enforced |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - 83/83 E2E incl. the VP-050 journey and the replacement-evidence rework journey; procedure status transitions recorded with actor identity |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
