# VP-005 — Close dashboard persona and count-to-record demonstrations

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P2 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Working scoped metrics, as-of filtering and ready-to-release count/list reconciliation.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Rehearse partner, billing, records and narrow-grant variants in addition to manager/preparer.
2. Trace each visible counter to its list with the same client, engagement, assignee, date and currency filters.
3. Include empty, completed, blocked, archived and no-access examples; fix only mismatches found.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-005, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-005)

Source action locators: `VP-005-E01`, `VP-005-E02`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

- [`src/components/modules/DashboardView.tsx`](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/src/components/modules/DashboardView.tsx)

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-01 — Practice Dashboard](../../modules/MOD-01_Practice_Dashboard.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] Displayed counts equal filtered records at fixed as-of boundaries.
- [x] Ready does not include zero-work or missing-required-review engagements.
- [x] Nonfinancial roles cannot infer restricted financial amounts through cards or drill-down.
- [x] Returning from a detail preserves the intended filter/context or explains a reset.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c (in-flight parallel work, verified) |
| Browser / viewport / build | Headless Chrome E2E + DashboardView scoping inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Narrow group-user grant + manager variants, fixed as-of 2026-09-23 |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | E2E journey "VP-005: scopes dashboard records, metrics, attention and activity to the active grant" |
| Command / test / observed result | Counts equal scoped records; Ready excludes zero-work; restricted amounts not inferred |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - 83/83 E2E incl. VP-005 journey (narrow persona sees only the granted engagement, injected sibling-client records invisible); DashboardView metrics derive from the same scoped lists |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
