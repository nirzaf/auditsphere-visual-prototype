# VP-006 — Finish client-profile lifecycle and stale-edit behavior

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P2 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Client creation/editing and linked shared records already present.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Compare required/optional profile fields to VP-006 before adding fields.
2. Demonstrate suspend/reactivate and soft archive with existing engagements, invoices and evidence; retain historical access appropriate to the role.
3. Test similar names, duplicate normalized codes, stale edits and rejected-save preservation.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-006, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-006)

Source action locators: `VP-006-E01`, `VP-006-R02`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

- [`src/components/modules/ClientsView.tsx`](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/src/components/modules/ClientsView.tsx)
- [`src/components/modules/ClientDetailView.tsx`](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/src/components/modules/ClientDetailView.tsx)

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-02 — CRM & Client Management](../../modules/MOD-02_CRM_Client_Management.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] All original contractual fields have an editable or deliberately read-only source.
- [x] Lifecycle transitions retain reason/actor/history and do not delete linked work.
- [x] Duplicate/conflicting edits reject without overwriting current records.
- [x] Client 360, search and related lists reflect the same current client state.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c |
| Browser / viewport / build | Chrome E2E + ClientProfileModal/prototypeStore inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Manager persona editing Example Trading Entity + new synthetic clients |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | updateClient(expectedProfileRevision) stale guard; getClientProfileWarnings duplicates; E2E profile edit journey |
| Command / test / observed result | Lifecycle edits in place with revision; stale/duplicate edits reject; linked records retained |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - E2E asserts "edit updates lifecycle fields in place with a revision" (profileRevision bump on Suspended); 191/191 unit includes client guards; linked engagements/contacts untouched by edits |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
