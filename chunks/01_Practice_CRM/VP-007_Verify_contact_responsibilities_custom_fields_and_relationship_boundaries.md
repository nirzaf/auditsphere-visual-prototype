# VP-007 — Verify contact responsibilities, custom fields and relationship boundaries

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P2 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Contact responsibility/effective-period fields are implemented; do not reopen VP-007-I01 as missing.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Finish contact edit/inactivate/primary-contact and effective-period combinations with historical references.
2. Validate every supported custom-field type/value and field-disable behavior.
3. Prove contacts and relationship-group membership do not grant portal or sibling-client authority.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-007, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-007)

Source action locators: `VP-007-E02`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-02 — CRM & Client Management](../../modules/MOD-02_CRM_Client_Management.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] One permitted active primary contact is preserved where required.
- [x] Invalid date ranges/custom values reject atomically.
- [x] Disabling a field/contact preserves prior values and references.
- [x] Group and contact changes do not widen any role grant.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c |
| Browser / viewport / build | Chrome E2E + updateClientContact store inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Client administrator persona, primary contact + relationship groups |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | updateClientContact atomic guard errors; E2E AT-05/AT-06 |
| Command / test / observed result | One active primary contact; invalid ranges reject atomically; disabled contacts keep references; no grant widening |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - 83/83 E2E incl. AT-05/06 (primary contact, non-authorizing relationship group); contact effectiveFrom/effectiveTo/active handled in one store call |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
