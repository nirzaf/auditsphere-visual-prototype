# VP-038 — Finish adjustment reflection and evidence-linked correction paths

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P1 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Draft/review/client-decision/reflection/amendment controls and no-double-count arithmetic.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Complete Rejected, Not reflected, Reflected, Partial and Unknown permutations on source replacement.
2. Link the exact evidence/workpaper/finding revisions required by the original journal criteria.
3. Show retained old approval/reflection history, impact totals and fresh technical/management decisions after amendment.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-038, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-038)

Source action locators: `VP-038-E01`, `VP-038-E02`, `VP-038-R03`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-22 — Adjustments & Journals](../../modules/MOD-22_Adjustments_Journals.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] Only eligible accepted unreflected reporting adjustments affect statements once.
- [x] Reflected replacement sources do not double-apply the same amount.
- [x] Partial/Unknown/missing proof blocks applicable final reporting with a visible reason.
- [x] Journal amendment and rejection retain history without real client/firm ledger posting.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c + committed base |
| Browser / viewport / build | Chrome E2E + adjustment reflection inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Preparer adds adjustment; reviewer accepts; client accepts reflection |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | E2E "AT-38: routes a new adjustment through independent technical review and client acceptance"; "AT-38/AT-40: includes an accepted unreflected adjustment in the financial statements" |
| Command / test / observed result | Only eligible accepted unreflected adjustments affect statements once; reflected replacements do not double-apply; partial/unknown proof blocks final reporting with a visible reason; amendment/rejection retain history without posting |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - 83/83 E2E incl. both AT-38 journeys; reflection status + source-version pinning drives inclusion exactly once |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
