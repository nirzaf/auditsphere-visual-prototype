# MOD-38 — Records & Archive

[All modules](../01_MODULE_INDEX.md) · [Presenter playbook](../02_CLIENT_DEMO_PLAYBOOK.md) · [Role handoffs](../reference/ROLE_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md)

**Repository-reported baseline:** `REPOSITORY_REPORTED_VERIFIED`  
**Client-demo rehearsal:** `NOT_RUN` by this review  
**Route / workspace:** `records`  
**Component owner:** `RecordsArchiveView`  
**Persona sequence:** records  
**Starting scenario:** `full-practice`  
**Source stories:** VP-059

## What already exists

Separate local archive copies, digest checks, successor lineage and hold/handover metadata are reported verified.

## Remaining work / demonstration limit

Preserve it; the presentation must explain local archive versus real retention clearly.

## How to demonstrate this module

These are source-derived rehearsal instructions. Exact final labels and pending controls must be checked against the current build; they are not a record of browser actions executed during this review. Where a required control remains pending, show its limitation or defer that step—do not simulate a successful business outcome.

1. Open Records & Archive for a released synthetic engagement.
2. Archive the exact release artifacts and inspect copied IDs, sizes and digests.
3. Review predecessor/successor records after an amended release.
4. Apply a local hold and demonstrate blocked handover; lift it through the permitted manual action.
5. Correct optional retention metadata with a reason and show the attributable history.

## Expected client-visible outcome

IndexedDB copies and app metadata can be cleared by the browser owner; no Purview, server immutability or automatic disposal is promised.

## Failure / denial / rework example

A held handover or mismatched artifact must be rejected without a falsely successful archive record.

## Implementation closure tasks

No module-specific implementation task is created: the source reports this module Verified. Preserve it and run the integration/presentation checks; do not rebuild it.

All modules also use [VP-003 shared forms/navigation](../chunks/00_Foundation/VP-003_Complete_cross_module_form_context_and_navigation_safeguards.md) and [DEMO-004 final rehearsal](../chunks/09_Client_Presentation/DEMO-004_Complete_the_client_demo_preflight_rehearsal_and_handoff.md).

## Rehearsal evidence to capture

| Step | Expected | Observed / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Entry and role/context | Correct permitted client/engagement and instructions | Not run |
| Main action and output | Outcome above; genuine supported file where applicable | Not run |
| Handoff / independent actor | Separate person; correct version | Not run / N/A with reason |
| Denial or rework | Explicit failure without data loss or bypass | Not run |
| Reload / return | Coherent record/history and context | Not run |

Record the final result in [module-demo signoff](../tracking/MODULE_DEMO_SIGNOFF.md). “Demonstrated” is a bounded prototype result, not a production or professional assurance claim.
