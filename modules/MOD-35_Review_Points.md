# MOD-35 — Review Points

[All modules](../01_MODULE_INDEX.md) · [Presenter playbook](../02_CLIENT_DEMO_PLAYBOOK.md) · [Role handoffs](../reference/ROLE_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md)

**Repository-reported baseline:** `REPOSITORY_REPORTED_VERIFIED`  
**Client-demo rehearsal:** `NOT_RUN` by this review  
**Route / workspace:** `reviews`  
**Component owner:** `ReviewDeskView`  
**Persona sequence:** reviewer → assigned responder → independent clearer  
**Starting scenario:** `audit-findings`  
**Source stories:** VP-055

## What already exists

Scoped cross-engagement queues, reassignment, exact-revision responses and independent clearance are reported verified.

## Remaining work / demonstration limit

Keep working behavior and rehearse one workpaper-target and one finding-target review.

## How to demonstrate this module

These are source-derived rehearsal instructions. Exact final labels and pending controls must be checked against the current build; they are not a record of browser actions executed during this review. Where a required control remains pending, show its limitation or defer that step—do not simulate a successful business outcome.

1. Open Review Desk, filter a permitted engagement and select RN-001/RN-002.
2. Raise a point on an exact workpaper/finding revision; assign an eligible responder.
3. Switch to that responder and attach a current response/evidence reference.
4. Switch to a different eligible clearer and close the point.
5. Revise the underlying subject and show a reopened point and required new response without changing finding disposition.

## Expected client-visible outcome

Open, Responded, Cleared and Reopened states and all assignment reasons remain attributable.

## Failure / denial / rework example

Responder self-clearance, stale responses and ungranted sibling queues/exports are denied.

## Implementation closure tasks

No module-specific implementation task is created: the source reports this module Verified. Preserve it and run the integration/presentation checks; do not rebuild it.

All modules also use [VP-003 shared forms/navigation](../chunks/00_Foundation/VP-003_Complete_cross_module_form_context_and_navigation_safeguards.md) and [DEMO-004 final rehearsal](../chunks/09_Client_Presentation/DEMO-004_Complete_the_client_demo_preflight_rehearsal_and_handoff.md).

## Rehearsal evidence to capture

| Step | Expected | Observed / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Entry and role/context | Correct permitted client/engagement and instructions | Not run |
| Main action and output | Outcome above; genuine supported file where applicable | Not run |
| Handoff / independent actor | Separate person; correct version | Not run / N/A with reason |
| Denial or rework | Explicit failure without data loss or bypass | Not run |
| Reload / return | Coherent record/history and context | Not run |

Record the final result in [module-demo signoff](../tracking/MODULE_DEMO_SIGNOFF.md). “Demonstrated” is a bounded prototype result, not a production or professional assurance claim.
