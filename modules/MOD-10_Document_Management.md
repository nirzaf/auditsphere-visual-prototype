## What already exists

Logical SharePoint hierarchy, metadata registration, revisions, availability, optional OneDrive and evidence replacement flows exist.

## Remaining work / demonstration limit

Complete idempotent workspace/rename/link matrices and truthful byte-availability explanations.

## How to demonstrate this module

These are source-derived rehearsal instructions. Exact final labels and pending controls must be checked against the current build; they are not a record of browser actions executed during this review. Where a required control remains pending, show its limitation or defer that step—do not simulate a successful business outcome.

1. Open Documents & SharePoint and select the client/engagement hierarchy.
2. Inspect a logical document ID, current revision, sharing and source classification.
3. Register a synthetic local file; distinguish metadata-only registration from a saved generated artifact or PBC blob.
4. Replace a document revision and inspect old evidence pins and required reassessment.
5. Rename/move or mark a reference unavailable, then restore it through the supported local control.

## Expected client-visible outcome

SharePoint is a simulated canonical hierarchy, not a live transfer; each storage class states whether bytes survive reload.

## Failure / denial / rework example

Wrong roots, cross-scope evidence and unavailable originals must not open or become adequate evidence.

## Implementation closure tasks

- [VP-020 — Verify logical workspace preparation and shared document links](../chunks/03_M365_Documents_Portal/VP-020_Verify_logical_workspace_preparation_and_shared_document_links.md)
- [VP-021 — Close document revision, availability and storage-class guidance](../chunks/03_M365_Documents_Portal/VP-021_Close_document_revision_availability_and_storage_class_guidance.md)

All modules also use [VP-003 shared forms/navigation](../chunks/00_Foundation/VP-003_Complete_cross_module_form_context_and_navigation_safeguards.md) and [DEMO-004 final rehearsal](../chunks/09_Client_Presentation/DEMO-004_Complete_the_client_demo_preflight_rehearsal_and_handoff.md).

## Rehearsal evidence to capture

| Step | Expected | Observed / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Entry and role/context | Correct permitted client/engagement and instructions | Not run |
| Main action and output | Outcome above; genuine supported file where applicable | Not run |
| Handoff / independent actor | Separate person; correct version | Not run / N/A with reason |
| Denial or rework | Explicit failure without data loss or bypass | Not run |
| Reload / return | Coherent record/history and context | Not run |

Record the final result in [module-demo signoff](../tracking/MODULE_DEMO_SIGNOFF.md). “Demonstrated” is a bounded prototype result, not a production or professional assurance claim.
