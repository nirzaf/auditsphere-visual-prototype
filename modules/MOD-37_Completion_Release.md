# MOD-37 — Completion & Release

[All modules](../01_MODULE_INDEX.md) · [Presenter playbook](../02_CLIENT_DEMO_PLAYBOOK.md) · [Role handoffs](../reference/ROLE_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md)

**Repository-reported baseline:** `REPOSITORY_REPORTED_VERIFIED`  
**Client-demo rehearsal:** `NOT_RUN` by this review  
**Route / workspace:** `delivery`  
**Component owner:** `ReleaseCompletionView`  
**Persona sequence:** partner / permitted release actor  
**Starting scenario:** `blocked-rework`  
**Source stories:** VP-057, VP-058

## What already exists

Readiness gates, exact artifact freeze/issue and amendment history are reported verified.

## Remaining work / demonstration limit

No replacement release engine; demonstrate blocking, resolution and exact local reissue.

## How to demonstrate this module

These are source-derived rehearsal instructions. Exact final labels and pending controls must be checked against the current build; they are not a record of browser actions executed during this review. Where a required control remains pending, show its limitation or defer that step—do not simulate a successful business outcome.

1. Open Release & Completion in Blocked / Rework State and inspect each blocker.
2. Navigate to the owning screen for a missing review/input instead of forcing Ready.
3. With the approved fixture, freeze the candidate and inspect exact artifact IDs and SHA-256s.
4. Issue locally; read the visible no-external-delivery statement.
5. Prepare an amendment, retain predecessor manifest and obtain fresh required decisions before reissue.

## Expected client-visible outcome

A local release record is not an email, provider delivery, signature or live client report issuance.

## Failure / denial / rework example

Missing approvals, changed bytes, stale generation and duplicate same-generation issue must fail.

## Implementation closure tasks

No module-specific implementation task is created: the source reports this module Verified. Preserve it and run the integration/presentation checks; do not rebuild it.

All modules also use [VP-003 shared forms/navigation](../chunks/00_Foundation/VP-003_Complete_cross_module_form_context_and_navigation_safeguards.md) and [DEMO-004 final rehearsal](../chunks/09_Client_Presentation/DEMO-004_Complete_the_client_demo_preflight_rehearsal_and_handoff.md).

## Rehearsal evidence to capture

| Step | Expected | Observed / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Entry and role/context | Correct permitted client/engagement and instructions | Not run |
| Main action and output | Outcome above; genuine supported file where applicable | Not run |
| Handoff / independent actor | Separate person; correct version | Not run / N/A with reason |
| Denial or rework | Explicit failure without data loss or bypass | Not run |
| Reload / return | Coherent record/history and context | Not run |

Record the final result in [module-demo signoff](../tracking/MODULE_DEMO_SIGNOFF.md). “Demonstrated” is a bounded prototype result, not a production or professional assurance claim.
